## Description

<!-- ![](./images/ice-t.jpg =200x) -->
Evaluating visualizations is complex. We have developed a value-driven methodology (called ICE-T) to help researchers, designers, and practitioners determine the _value_ of visualizations.

This site contains links to the research papers describing the methodology, supplemental material about the study, and materials available for download so that others can use the methodology.

## Materials

To conduct an evaluation of a visualization using our ICE-T methodology, we provide the following material.

First, you will need one or more visualizations to evaluate. Ideally, these visualization exhibit a reasonable amount of complexity and interactivity (i.e., not a simple, static visual chart).

Next, recruit participants to conduct the study. Each participant should be given a description of the visualization so that they are knowledgeable about how the visualization works, and what data is being shown. How many participants are needed depends on the particular experimental design.

Each participant should fill out the [ICE-T survey form](documents/survey.pdf) for every visualization being evaluated.

Once each participant has completed the survey, the scores from the heuristics can be analyzed, and the _value_ of the visualization determined.
